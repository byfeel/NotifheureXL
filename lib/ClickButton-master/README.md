# ClickButton

*A simple one-button Arduino library to get short and long clicks, multiple clicks (double click, triple click etc.). Click-and-hold is also possible.*

Original source: [https://code.google.com/archive/p/clickbutton/](https://code.google.com/archive/p/clickbutton/)  


## Features: Button clicks, basically :)

Buttons (Or rather the input signal)
Debounced (Default: 20 ms debounce timer)
Current state
Active low (can use the internal pullup-resistor)
Active high
Clicks (IE signal timings)
Short click(s) (Default: Click count within 250 ms)
Long click(s) (Default: Last click is held down for at least 1 second)
Dynamic settings for short/long clicks and debounce timers.


##Details (some of them anyway)

**Short clicks** is simply the number of clicks within a set timelimit (default 250 ms).

**Long clicks** are clicks where the last click is held down for a "longer" time. As suggested any preceding clicks (if applicable) must be short clicks. (I just thought it would be kind of boring to have lots of long multiple clicks). * Example: a "long double-click" (if there is such a thing) is just a normal double-click where the button is held down at the last click, then it may be released after a time (default 1 second).

**Click-and-hold** can also be determined, simply by getting a long click and then checking that the button is still held down.

The debounced button state is also available at any time.

Easy to change default timer settings for button debounce, short and long clicks (on-the-fly if you want - not that you'd want to do that all the time, probably).

One "ClickButton" instance copes with only one button, individually. One must instantiate several ClickButton objects if one wants to use more than one button. If you want to combine several buttons, you must do so in your own code.

A multiple buttons example is included (using an array of ClickButton objects).

#Notes

This is just me trying to learn some more basic OO (about time!). This library started with me extending a bit on the Arduino debounce tutorial, and as it turned out what I deemed OK-ish, I thought this might be useful for others too. So I "librarized" it.

BIGish WARNING The "click codes" (click counts) are now the opposite of the earlier versions prior to 2013 (Oops.. I keep messing things up it seems! I just recently discovered that I named the latest archived version with the wrong year 2012 ! It is from 2013 (or is that was? - Either way it's the most current one in the downloads))! The below is what the returned .clicks variable value means: * Short clicks have a positive value * Long clicks have a negative value (The absolute value is the click count).

Another biggie is the change of a few variable (property) names.

See the Usage page for more.

#Usage
Installing and usage of the ClickButton library

##Installing

For Arduino 0017 onwards, just extract the contents of the archive into the "libraries" folder located in your sketchbook folder.

##Syntax

To instantiate a ClickButton object named buttonObject  
` ClickButton buttonObject(pin [,active [,CLICKBTN_PULLUP]]);`

where: * buttonObject is your name for the button object in code. * pin is the pin connected to the button * active denotes an active LOW or HIGH button (default is LOW) * CLICKBTN_PULLUP turns on the internal pullup resistor. This is only possible with active low buttons.

##Notes of notable warnings

**Avoid using delay()!**

It stops everything (except interrupts) that the Arduino does. Then the button timings may get delayed(!) too much, and the library will not work as intended.

**Also avoid using a "home-made" delay-without-delay kind of delay !!**

It doesn't really matter if you use the built-in delay() function, or if you make, say a for-loop, while-loop or similar, just wasting time and CPU cycles.. it's still a form of delay. In which case I'd say it's likely that you should rethink your "game engine" (or main() loop).

Instead, have a look at Blink without delay and AvoidDelay on the Arduino site for more.

**Avoid using it from inside interrupts**

By "it" I mean this library. ISR / Interrupts stops most other things in the micro-controller (Arduino), including the timer counter obtainable from the millis() function. ClickButton is rather dependent on this timer..

##Functions

(Note the buttonObject is just a placeholder for any object name you use, of course)

**Update()**

The only function.

Type: void (returns nothing).

`buttonObject.Update();`

Reads the button, debounces it, and updates it's click count. This should basically be read once each main program loop.

Note that the click count is lost after the button is released and the Update() function is called.

Public variables / members

.clicks

(formerly ".click" - without the "s")

Returns the button click count (also possible to set as well, but that wouldn't seem too useful).

This will be reset to zero after the button is released and another call to the Update() is made, so you probably need to save this value for later (See example code at the bottom of page).

`buttonClicks = buttonObject.clicks`

**Returned click counts:**


* A **positive** number returns the number of short clicks.  
* A **negative** number indicates long clicks (or possibly click-and-hold).  


"Short" clicks is simply the number of button clicks within a set timelimit (the .multiclickTime public variable. Default 250 ms, or 0.25 seconds).

"Long clicks" are really just the last click that is held down for a "longer" time (Default 1 second). The preceding clicks, if present, are simply just short clicks. The returned absolute value is the number of clicks (including the last button hold-down).

A "click-and-hold" can be determined simply by getting a "long click" and then checking that the button is still held down (via the .depressed public variable. See the "LEDfader" example that comes with the library).

**.depressed**

Returns the currently debounced button (press) state.

true = button is pressed down
false = button is not pressed down.
This value is independent of button logic (active high or low).

Intended use is for a "click-and-hold" function, by checking if a button is still held down after a long click. But it also serves as an immediate, debounced button state.

`if (buttonClicks == -1 && buttonObject.depressed == true) then its-still-held-down;`

**.debounceTime**

Sets / gets the time limit for ignoring button bounces.

If multiple clicks / signals are received within this time limit, they are ignored (So, do not set this too high or too similar to multiclickTime. Also, do not double-click faster than this :P)

`buttonObject.debounceTime = 20; // debounce time set to 20 milliseconds`

**.multiclickTime**

(Yes, it's spelled like that, no capitalization on 'click'.. since I was thinking of 'multiclick' as one word. Might be a bit counterproductive, but for the time being that's what it is)

Sets / gets the time limit for clicks.

If you want to do multiple clicks (like a double click), you must do it within this time limit. Default is set to 250 ms (0.25 seconds).

This also goes for single clicks, so this will be the delay determining when the single (or multiple) clicks are registered.

`buttonObject.multiclickTime = 250;`

**.longClickTime**

(Formerly ".heldDownTime")

Sets / gets the minimum time for a "long click" (holding down the button for an extended time).

The returned click count will be negative (indicating a long click), and the absolute nr. is the number of (short) clicks right before and including the last long button press.

Default long click minimum held-down time is set to 1 second.

`buttonObject.longClickTime = 1000; // Sets minimum long click held-down time to 1 second`

**.changed**

Gets set to true if clicks count has a new value, and is set to false in the next cycle. Useful if you want to act on a new user interaction like an event.

## MultiClicks example sketch

This example is included with the library. Using an active-low button, and using the internal pull-up resistor of the Atmega chip.  

'/* ClickButton library demo

Blinks a LED according to different clicks on one button.

Short clicks:

Single click - Toggle LED on/off
Double click - Blink      (Toggles LED 2 times/second)
Triple click - Fast blink (Toggles LED 5 times/second)

Long clicks (hold button for one second or longer on last click):

Single-click - Slow blink   (Toggles LED every second)
Double-click - Sloow blink  (Toggles LED every other second)
Triple-click - Slooow blink (Toggles LED every three seconds)

The circuit: - LED attached from pin 10 to resistor (say 220-ish ohms), other side of resistor to GND (ground) - pushbutton attached from pin 4 to GND No pullup resistor needed, using the Arduino's (Atmega's) internal pullup resistor in this example.

Based on the Arduino Debounce example.
